# Analyzing-Google-App-Store-dataset

## Abstract:
Google play store is engulfed with a few thousands of new applications regularly with 
a progressively huge number of designers working freely or on the other hand in a group 
to make them successful, with the enormous challenge from everywhere throughout the 
globe. Since most Play Store applications are free, the income model is very obscure 
and inaccessible regarding how the in-application buys, adverts and memberships add 
to the achievement of an application. In this way an application's prosperity is normally 
dictated by the quantity of installation of the application and the client appraisals that it 
has gotten over its lifetime instead of the income is created.
This project aims to deliver insights through the ratings of Google Play Store apps using 
Python libraries by performing data Analysis into the Google Play store application 
dataset that has been collected from Kaggle and then discover the relationships among 
various attributes present in the dataset such as which application is free or paid, about 
the user reviews, rating of the application, etc.

## Objective:
The goal is to help android developers to know what is the motivating factor for people to
download an app. It will also help to find out the factors that affect someone’s decision 
to download an app. <br>
The aim of my analysis is to provide insights about android applications and their 
categories. I want to dive deep in data for the factors of influences on an application, to 
know why and how certain applications succeed others. Also, what is required for an 
application to be considered as successfully topping the charts.
This project focuses on the analysis of the Play Store data set in Kaggle. The aim of 
this project is: 
• To use the data to analyse consumer trends and determine which type of apps are the 
most popular and profitable. <br>
• Classify applications based on their categories. <br>
• Present the growth of applications through years. <br>
• Compare different categories of applications based on the Android version. <br>
• Compare the rates in different kinds of applications. <br>
• Assess supported Android version with numbers of reviews based on different 
categories

## Tools Used:
- Python and its libraries <br>
- MS-Excel <br>
- Tableau Public <br>

## Flow:
Our analysis approach is divided into 4 phases: <br>
➢ Data Extraction and Preparation <br>
➢ Data Cleansing and Data Mining <br>
➢ Data Imputation & Manipulation <br>
➢ Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization & Dashboarding <br>
